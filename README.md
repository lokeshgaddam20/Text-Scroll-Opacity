## Text Scroll Gradient Effect

We see an amazing incoming text with opacity changes as the page scrolls.
Built using Nextjs and Framer Motion .

We will use Sass for the stylesheets, so we can run ``` npm I saas ```

We will use Framer Motion for the animation, so we can run ``` npm i framer-motion ```

So to run the app, we need to ``` npm run dev ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
